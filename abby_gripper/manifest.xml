  <description brief="abby_gripper">
    An arduino-based package to control the solenoid valve that actuates the gripper.
    
    The ino file in this package is the service server for the gripper. It should be
    compiled and loaded to the arduino. It is connected to the ROS master via ROSSerial.
    
    Also in this package are a service definition and supporting messages to allow development of
    clients to control the gripper. These should be run on the robot's computer.
    
    Compiling the arduino sketches also requires that you copy/symlink the 
    rosserial_arduino package's roslib into your arduino sketchbook directory's libraries.
    See the rosseral_arduino tutorials for more information.
    
    You will also have to generate message header files for the server messages
    to compile on the arduino and put them in your sketchbook directory's libraries using
    rosserial_client make_library.py
    
    This package also contains an action definition and an action server client. Development
    of the arduino action server was suspended when it was found that properly porting actionlib
    to the arduino would be a large undertaking. A normal service was deemed to be a suitable
    alternative.
